# TeTris

My own TeTris game made with Java.
It is a normal tetris with sound and effects.

move blocks: arrow key right and left(down to move it down)
rotate: key z and x for counter-clockwise and clockwise

* To play the game, download all the codes and save it in .jar file. Then, download the Game File and 
put both file in the same folder. Enjoy the game!
